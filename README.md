# Healthcare Management System

This healthcare management system is designed for the purpose of scheduling and managing doctor's appointments from the patient's side, as well as from the doctor's side. It allows for a quick appointment booking process, eliminating the need for going to the hospital in person just to schedule a visit with a doctor. This system also supports cancelling or rescheduling appointments, as well as transferring documents (such as prescriptions or bills).

## Features

### 1. Login / register page

The login / register feature lets users create their profile or simply log in (if they already have an account). The user is presented with the login fields, but is redirected to the register page by the 'register' button if they are a first time user. When the user accesses their profile, they are navigated to their profile page.

### 2. Appointments page (patient)

The appointments page displays the patient's existing appointments which they can view, cancel or reschedule. The page also has a 'Schedule an appointment' button, which navigates the patient to the appointment scheduling page. 

The patient books an appointment by selecting the hospital ward and their preferred doctor and provides the doctor with information about when they are available for check-up. The doctor's role is to accept or reject that appointment and notify the patient about the exact time of their appointment.
If the patient cannot make it to the scheduled appointment, they can either cancel it or reschedule it.
